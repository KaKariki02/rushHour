# Update RushHour 23rd of november  

We have created three files. Algorithms.py contains the algorithms, RushClass.py contains the classes and RushHour is the main file.  

## Done:  
-Initialisation of a board with a grid system  
-The car id, x position, y position, orientation and length get retrieved from a CSV file.  
-Printing of a empty board  
-Printing of a start board  
-The programme prints a list of possible moves    
-Implement a random board solver: `randomSolver`  
-Capturing the lists of possible moves  
-A "win function"  
-Implement a breadth first search  
-Comparison between a breadth first search with and without an archive

## Todo:  
-backtracing the solution  
-counting number of steps to solution  
-pruning  
-visualization of the board  
-make our code applicable for other board sizes  
-Comments in code  
-scorefunction boards/ priority queue  
-gitignore
