Update RushHour 15th of november

We have deleted the old RushHour file due to many conflicts within github.
iris.py is now the leading file

following steps are implemented:
-Initialisation of a board with a grid system
-The car id, x position, y position, orientation and length get retrieved from a CSV file.
-Printing of a empty board
-Printing of a start board
-The programme prints a list of possible moves

We are working on:
-A "win function"__
-Capturing the lists of possible moves
-Print the new possible moves on a board

Tod:
-initial implementation of BFS
-think about the size of our statespace
