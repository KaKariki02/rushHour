The results of the breadth first search and the depth first search show that the the first algorithm always finds the solution in less steps than the dept first search. It has to move the cars less number of times to get the red car to the exit. This is because the breadth first search algorithm first checks all the children of every node and then continues to the next 'generation' of children. However the depth first search is faster if you take a look at the number of nodes it needs to make. It only checks one child of a node and continues with that child and so it continues. It doesn't check all the children of one node, causing a faster way to find a path to the solution.
The difference between the two algorithms is more or less equal for every gameboard.
